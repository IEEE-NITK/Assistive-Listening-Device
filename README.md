# Assistive-Listening-Device
## Introduction
The Assistive Listening Device is designed to aid individuals with auditory disabilities by cancelling external noise and boosting frequencies associated with hearing loss. This project utilises MEMS microphone along with Raspberry Pi for audio processing and transmission to an in-ear speaker.
## Technologies Used

## Implementation 
 ~~Audio Collection:-~~ Audio is captured using an IM69DI30 microphone.
### Audio Processing 
The captured audio is processed using python on a Raspberry Pi3.
### Noise cancellation and frequency boosting
The processed audio undergoes noise cancellation and frequency boosting algorithms implemented using Python libraries such as pywavelets,numpy and scipy.
### Wireless Transmission
The processed audio is wirelessly transmitted to the in-ear speaker for playback.
